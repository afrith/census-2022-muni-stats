# Census 2022 Municipal Stats

This repository contains provincial and municipal statistics from South Africa's 2022 census.
These stats have been extracted from the publication
[Census 2022 Provinces at a glance](https://census.statssa.gov.za/assets/documents/2022/Provinces_at_a_Glance.pdf)
which was released by Stats SA on 10 October 2023. I extracted them by using
[Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) followed by manual cleanup.

The files here are:

* `person-indicators-province.csv`: Person indicators per province
* `person-indicators-district.csv`: Person indicators per district municipality
* `person-indicators-muni.csv`: Person indicators per local/metro municipality
